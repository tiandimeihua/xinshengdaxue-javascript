# 【10.8】Multiple choice questions and explain your choice

---

questions:

Those two are Multiple Choice questions, if possible please do not use your vsCode and give the answers.

When you explain the reasons you may use anything you want.

question 1:

```javascript
function bar(){
    return foo;
    foo = 10;
    function foo(){
    }
    var foo = "11";
}

console.log(typeof bar());

a. String   b. Error    c. function     d. Number   e. undefined
```

question 2:

```javascript
function ahahaha(){
    return
    var test= {
        name:"xiaoming"     //换成 xuShuai 会不会被打？
    }

    test = 18

    test = "Thank you for your teaching"
}

console.log( typeof ahahaha());

a. String   b. Error    c. function     d. Number   e. undefined
```

Give your answer and explain the reason,

Thank you for your reading.

solution:

question 1:

explanation: it is easy to make the mistake of thinking the above will result in Undefined. The result is function becasue javascript is compiled by environment (bowsers or node or etc) instead of being the purely interpreted language. While the function bar() are evaluated during compiled time, both function bar() and foo() are created. Since foo() in function bar() local scopes. However, in the question, I used the function definations for foo(), if I used function expression, the result will be undefined.

compiled 编译

purely interpreted language 纯粹解释执行语言

function definations 函数定义式

function expression 函数表达式

How it work in memory:

```javascript

    // just scan function all in memory, not run anything yet.
1   function bar(){
        return foo;
        foo = 10;
        function foo(){
        }
        var foo = "11";
    }

    //if function bar() no return, it will be function for bar();
    //if function bar() return;, it will also be function for bar();
    //if function bar() return "something";, then we need to find the typeof "something"
2   console.log(typeof bar());

    //run function bar()
3   function bar(){
    function foo(){     //because javascript is the compiled language,
    }                   //function foo() hoisting, although it not run;
    return foo;         //return foo();
}

4   console.log(typeof foo());      //function;
```

question 2:

This is really tricky,

put the code your vsCode, use the formate expand, it will show your answer.

```javascript
function ahahaha() {
  return;
  var test = {
    name: "xiaoming" //换成 xuShuai 会不会被打？
  };

  test = 18;

  test = "Thank you for your teaching";
}

console.log(typeof ahahaha());
```

@XuShuai

在实际编码中运用两点技巧，这类问题永远不会困扰我们。

1. 变量命名的重要性！
1. 用 let 不是 var。
